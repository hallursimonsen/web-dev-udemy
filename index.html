            the image also disappears on your website. My image source is within the folder 'HTML - PERSONAL SITE'
            so it won't disappear. Also the 'alt=' is a text that describes the image. This can be helpful for 
            search engine results, but also if the image disappears it displays the text, describing the image.-->

            <!-- A paragraph contraining info about myself. 
            In this first line of code we see that there is a "<i>" tag after the paragraph tag. 
            This is the Italicized Tag in HTML, which will make the text contained inside italicized. 
            Then there is the "<font>" tag. This is the font formatting tag in HTML.
            This tag can contain attirbutes. In this instance I have chosen to use the size attribute.
            Which will rezise the text contained between the start tag and closing tag.-->
            <p><i><font size="+1">C</font>ertified</i> 
            <!-- While Continuing in the same paragraph we see "<b>" tag.
            This is the bold tag used in HTML.-->

            <!-- Now we arrive at another tag "<em>".
            This is the emphazised tag in HTML, used to emphazise text.
            This tag italicizes the text, just like the "<i>" tag does.
            It tells the browser that the text contained should be stressed/emphazised.
            It conveys more information to the browser, than only using the styling ability of "<i>".
            E.g. if you needed to emphazise a word read out loud by a computer, the "<em>" would be emphazised.-->
